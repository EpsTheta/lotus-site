## Friends

The native Among Us friends list is often considered pointless. However, with this system, you can create your own custom friend list easily using simple commands through the command line.

The friend list information is stored in the file `LOTUS_DATA/Friends.txt`.

Commands:

| Command                     | Function                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/friend add [playerId]`    | Adds a friend based on their player ID (1 - 15) |
| `/friend add [name]`        | Adds a friend based on their username           |
| `/friend remove [index]`    | Removes a friend based on their list position   |
| `/friend list`              | Lists all friends                               |


## Other Useful Commands

Here are some additional commands that you might find useful:

- `/kick [id]`: Kick a player based on their ID.
- `/ban [id]`: Ban a player based on their ID.

Use `/kick` or `/ban` without specifying an ID to obtain a list of available player IDs.
